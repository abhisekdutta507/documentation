### Collection in MongoDB

  * A collection is a group of documents and is similar to a table in relational databases.
  * Each `Collection` can contain multiple `Documents`.

### Document in MongoDB

  * A document is a single data record, stored in a format called BSON.
  * Every document has a unique `_id` field that acts as its primary key, either assigned automatically or specified by the user.
