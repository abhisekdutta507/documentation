### What is Event Loop?

The event loop is a concept in Node.js that allows it to handle asynchronous operations efficiently.

#### What it is:

- An endless loop that continuously monitors for events and tasks.
- Responsible for executing asynchronous code in Node.js.
- Enables Node.js to be single-threaded while still handling multiple tasks side by side.

#### How it works:

1. **Queues:** The event loop maintains different queues for various types of tasks. These queues hold callbacks (functions to be executed) waiting for their turn.
1. **Call Stack:** The call stack keeps track of the currently executing functions.
1. **Event Loop Cycle:**
    - The event loop constantly checks the call stack.
    - If the call stack is empty, it moves to the next available queue and picks up a callback function.
    - The function is then placed on the call stack and executed.
    - This process repeats until all queues are empty or a maximum number of callbacks are executed in a single loop (to prevent infinite loops).

#### Benefits of the Event Loop:

1. **Non-Blocking I/O:** Enables Node.js to perform I/O operations (like reading/writing files, network requests) without blocking the main thread. This allows the event loop to handle other tasks while waiting for I/O to complete.
2. **Scalability:** Node.js can handle a high number of concurrent connections because the event loop efficiently manages tasks without blocking.

#### Example to Illustrate Event Loop:

```js
console.log('Start');

// Timer
setTimeout(() => {
  console.log('Timeout callback');
}, 0);

// Immediate
setImmediate(() => {
  console.log('Immediate callback');
});

console.log('End');
```

Output:

```shell
Start
End
Immediate callback
Timeout callback
```

Explanation:

1. Start and End are logged first since they are synchronous.
1. Immediate callback follows since itâ€™s scheduled with setImmediate.
1. Finally, Timeout callback runs, as timers are checked after the I/O and immediate callbacks.
