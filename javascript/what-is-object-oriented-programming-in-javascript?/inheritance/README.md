## What is Inheritance?

Inheritance in **Object-Oriented Programming** (OOP) is a mechanism that allows a class (subclass) to inherit properties and methods from another class (superclass). Inheritance promotes code reusability.

In different programming languages the concept of Inheritance can be different. For eg. Java & C++ both Object-Oriented Programming languages follow different Inheritance practices.
